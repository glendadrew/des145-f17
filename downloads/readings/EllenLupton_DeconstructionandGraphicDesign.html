			<h2>Deconstruction and Graphic Design</h2>
			<div class="entry">
				<p>Ellen Lupton and J. Abbott Miller. Published in special issue of <cite>Visible Language</cite>
 on graphic design history, edited by Andrew Blauvelt (1994). This is an
 earlier version of the essay “Deconstruction and Graphic Design,” 
published in our book <cite>Design Writing Research</cite>.</p>
<p><span id="more-300"></span></p>
<p>Since the surfacing of the term “deconstruction” in design journalism
 in the mid-1980s, the word has served to label architecture, graphic 
design, products, and fashion featuring chopped up, layered, and 
fragmented forms imbued with ambiguous futuristic overtones. This essay 
looks at the reception and use of deconstruction in the recent history 
of graphic design, where it has become the tag for yet another period 
style.</p>
<p>We then consider the place of graphics within the theory of 
deconstruction, initiated in the work of philosopher Jacques Derrida. We
 argue that deconstruction is not a style or “attitude” but rather a 
mode of questioning through and about the technologies, formal devices, 
social institutions, and founding metaphors of representation. 
Deconstruction belongs to both history and theory. It is embedded in 
recent visual and academic culture, but it describes a strategy of 
critical form-making which is performed across a range of artifacts and 
practices, both historical and contemporary.</p>
<p>Jacques Derrida introduced the concept of “deconstruction” in his 
book Of Grammatology, published in France in 1967 and translated into 
English in 1976. “Deconstruction” became a banner for the advance guard 
in American literary studies in the 1970s and 80s, scandalizing 
departments of English, French, and comparative literature. 
Deconstruction rejected the project of modern criticism: to uncover the 
meaning of a literary work by studying the way its form and content 
communicate essential humanistic messages. Deconstruction, like critical
 strategies based on Marxism, feminism, semiotics, and anthropology, 
focuses not on the themes and imagery of its objects but rather on the 
linguistic and institutional systems that frame the production of texts.</p>
<p>In Derrida’s theory, deconstruction asks how representation inhabits 
reality. How does the external image of things get inside their internal
 essence? How does the surface get under the skin? Western culture since
 Plato, Derrida argues, has been governed by such oppositions as 
reality/representation, inside/outside, original/copy, and mind/body. 
The intellectual achievements of the West—its science, art, philosophy, 
literature—have valued one side of these pairs over the other, allying 
one side with truth and the other with falsehood. For example, the 
Judeo-Christian tradition has conceived the body as an external shell 
for the inner soul, elevating the mind as the sacred source of thought 
and spirit, while denigrating the body as mere mechanics. In the realm 
of aesthetics, the original work of art traditionally has carried an 
aura of authenticity that its copy lacks, and the telling of a story or 
the taking of a photograph is viewed as a passive record of events.</p>
<p>“Deconstruction” takes apart such oppositions by showing how the 
devalued, empty concept lives inside the valued, positive one. The 
outside inhabits the inside. Consider, for example, the opposition 
between nature and culture. The idea of “nature” depends on the idea of 
“culture,” and yet culture is part of nature. It’s a fantasy to conceive
 of the non-human environment as a pristine, innocent setting fenced off
 and protected from the products of human endeavor—cities, roads, farms,
 landfills. The fact that we have produced a concept of “nature” in 
opposition to “culture” is a symptom of our alienation from the 
ecological systems that civilization depletes and transforms.</p>
<p>A crucial opposition for deconstruction is speech/writing. The 
Western philosophical tradition has denigrated writing as an inferior 
copy of the spoken word. Speech draws on interior consciousness, but 
writing is dead and abstract. The written word loses its connection to 
the inner self. Language is set adrift, untethered from the speaking 
subject. In the process of embodying language, writing steals its soul. 
Deconstruction views writing as an active rather than passive form of 
representation. Writing is not merely a bad copy, a faulty 
transcription, of the spoken word; writing, in fact, invades thought and
 speech, transforming the sacred realms of memory, knowledge, and 
spirit. Any memory system, in fact, is a form of writing, since it 
records thought for the purpose of future transmissions.</p>
<p>The speech/writing opposition can be mapped onto a series of 
ideologically loaded pairs that are constitutive of modern Western 
culture:</p>
<p>Speech/Writing<br>
Natural/artificial<br>
Spontaneous/constructed<br>
Original/copy<br>
interior to the mind/exterior to the mind<br>
requires no equipment/requires equipment<br>
intuitive/learned<br>
present subject/absent subject</p>
<p>Derrida’s critique of the speech/writing opposition locates the 
concerns of deconstruction in the field of graphic design. We will 
return to the speech/writing problem in more detail later, but first, we
 will look at the life of deconstruction in recent design culture.</p>
<p>The Design History of Deconstruction</p>
<p>Deconstruction belongs to the broader critical field known as 
“post-structuralism,” whose key figures include Roland Barthes, Michel 
Foucault, Jean Baudrillard, and others. Each of these writers has looked
 at modes of representation—from literature and photography to the 
design of schools and prisons—as powerful technologies which build and 
remake the social world. Deconstruction’s attack on the neutrality of 
signs is also at work in the consumer mythologies of Barthes, the 
institutional archaeologies of Foucault, and the simulationist 
aesthetics of Baudrillard.</p>
<p>The idea that cultural forms help to fabricate such seemingly 
“natural” categories as race, sexuality, poetic genius, and aesthetic 
value had profound relevance to visual artists in the 1980s. 
Post-structuralism provided a critical avenue into “post-modernism,” 
posing a left-leaning alternative to the period’s nostalgic returns to 
figurative painting and neo-classical architecture. While Barbara 
Kruger, Cindy Sherman, and Victor Burgin attacked media myths through 
their visual work, books such as Hal Foster’s The Anti-Aesthetic and 
Terry Eagleton’s Literary Theory delivered post-structuralist theory to 
students in an accessible form.</p>
<p>Graphic designers in many U. S. art programs were exposed to critical
 theory through the fields of photography, performance and installation 
art during the early 1980s. The most widely publicized intersection of 
post-structuralism and graphic design occurred at the Cranbrook Academy 
of Art, under the leadership of co-chair Katherine McCoy. Designers at 
Cranbrook had first confronted literary criticism when they designed a 
special issue of Visible Language on contemporary French literary 
aesthetics, published in the summer of 1978. Daniel Libeskind, head of 
Cranbrook’s architecture program, provided the graphic designers with a 
seminar in literary theory, which prepared them to develop their 
strategy: to systematically disintegrate the the series of essays by 
expanding the spaces between lines and words and pushing the footnotes 
into the space normally reserved for the main text. French Currents of 
the Letter, which outraged designers committed to the established 
ideologies of problem-solving and direct communication, remains a 
controversial landmark in experimental graphic design.</p>
<p>According to Katherine McCoy, post-structuralist texts entered more 
general discussions at Cranbrook around 1983. She has credited Jeffery 
Keedy, a student at the school from 1983-85, with introducing fellow 
course members to books by Barthes and others. The classes of 1985/87 
and 1986/88 also took an active interest in critical theory; students at
 this time included Andrew Blauvelt, Brad Collins, Edward Fella, David 
Frej, and Allen Hori. Close interaction with the photography department,
 under the leadership of Carl Toth, further promoted dialogue about 
post-structuralism and visual practice.</p>
<p>Post-structuralism did not serve as a unified methodology at the 
school, however, even in the period of its strongest currency, but was 
part of an eclectic gathering of ideas. According to Keedy, students at 
Cranbrook when he was there were looking at everything from alchemical 
mysticism to the “proportion voodoo” of the golden section. McCoy 
recalled in a 1991 interview: “Theory had become part of the 
intellectual culture in art and photography. We were never trying to 
apply specific texts—it was more of a general filtration process. The 
term ‘deconstructivist’ drives me crazy. Post-structuralism is an 
attitude, not a style.” But what is the difference between “style” and 
“attitude”? If “style” is a grammar of form-making associated with a 
particular historical and cultural situation, then perhaps “attitude” is
 the unarticulated, just out-of-focus background for the specificities 
of style.</p>
<p>The response to post-structuralism at Cranbrook was largely 
optimistic, side-stepping the profound pessimism and political critique 
that permeates these writers’ major works. McCoy used the architectural 
theory of Robert Venturi and Denise Scott Brown as a “stepping stone” to
 post-structuralism, enabling her to merge the Pop aestheticization of 
the American commercial vernacular with post-structuralism’s critique of
 “fixed meaning.” McCoy’s preference for celebration over criticism is 
echoed in Keedy’s comment, “It was the poetic aspect of Barthes which 
attracted me, not the Marxist analysis. After all, we’re designers 
working in a consumer society, and while Marxism is interesting as an 
idea, I wouldn’t want to put it into practice.”</p>
<p>Post-structuralism’s emphasis on the openness of meaning has been 
incorporated by many designers into a romantic theory of 
self-expression: as the argument goes, because signification is not 
fixed in material forms, designers and readers share in the spontaneous 
creation of meaning. This approach represents a rather cheerful response
 to the post-structuralist theme of the “death of the author” and the 
assertion that the interior self is constructed by external technologies
 of representation. According to the writings of Barthes and Foucault, 
for example, the citizen/artist/producer is not the imperious master of 
systems of language, media, education, custom, and so forth; instead, 
the individual operates within the limited grid of possibilities these 
codes make available. Rather than view meaning as a matter of private 
interpretation, post-structuralist theory tends to see the realm of the 
“personal” as structured by external signs. Invention and revolution 
come from tactical aggressions against this grid of possibilities.</p>
<p>“Deconstructivism” catapulted into the mainstream design press with 
MoMA’s 1988 exhibition Deconstructivist Architecture, curated by Philip 
Johnson and Mark Wigley. The curators used the term “deconstructivism” 
to link certain contemporary architectural practices to Russian 
Constructivism, whose early years were marked by an imperfect vision of 
form and technology. The MoMA exhibition located a similarly skewed 
interpretation of modernism in the work of Frank Gehry, Daniel 
Libeskind, Peter Eisenman, and others. Wigley wrote in his catalogue 
essay: “A deconstructive architect is…not one who dismantles buildings, 
but one who locates the inherent dilemmas within buildings. The 
deconstructive architect puts the pure forms of the architectural 
tradition on the couch and identifies the symptoms of a repressed 
impurity. The impurity is drawn to the surface by a combination of 
gentle coaxing and violent torture: the form is interrogated” (11). In 
Wigley’s view, deconstruction in architecture asks questions about 
modernism by re-examining its own language, materials, and processes.</p>
<p>By framing their exhibition around a new “ism,” Wigley and Johnson 
helped to canonize the elements of a period style, marked by twisted 
geometries, centerless plans, and shards of glass and metal. This 
cluster of stylistic features quickly emigrated from architecture to 
graphic design, just as the icons and colors of neo-classical 
post-modernism had traveled there shortly before. While a more critical 
approach to deconstruction had been routed to graphic designers through 
the fields of photography and the fine arts, architecture provided a 
ready-to-use formal vocabulary that could be broadly adopted. 
“Deconstruction,” “deconstructivism,” and just plain “decon” became 
design-world clichés, where they named existing tendencies and catalyzed
 new ones in the fields of furniture and fashion as well as graphic 
design.</p>
<p>In 1990 Philip Meggs published a how-to guide for would-be 
deconstructivists in the magazine Step-by-Step Graphics. His essay, 
which includes a journalistic account of how the term “deconstruction” 
entered the field of graphic design, focuses on style and works back to 
theory. Following the logic of the MoMA project, his story begins with 
Constructivism and ends with its “deconstruction” in contemporary 
design; unlike Wigley, however, Meggs’s story depicts early modernism as
 a purely rational enterprise.</p>
<p>Chuck Byrne and Martha Witte¹s more analytical piece for Print (1990)
 describes deconstruction as a “zeitgeist,” a philosophical germ 
circulating in contemporary culture that influences graphic designers 
even though they might not know it. Their view corresponds roughly to 
McCoy’s sense of post-structuralism as a general “attitude” or 
“filtration process” responding to the “intellectual culture” of the 
time. Byrne and Witte’s article identifies examples of deconstruction 
across the ideological map of contemporary design, ranging from the work
 of Paula Scher and Stephen Doyle to Lucille Tenazas and Lorraine Wild.</p>
<p>Today, in the mid-90s, the term “deconstruction” is used casually to 
label any work that favors complexity over simplicity and dramatizes the
 formal possibilities of digital production—the term is commonly used to
 invoke a generic allegiance with “Cranbrook” or “CalArts,” a gesture 
which reduces both schools to flat symbols by blanketing a variety of 
distinct practices. Our view of deconstruction in graphic design is at 
once narrower and broader in its scope than the view evolving from the 
current discourse. Rather than look at deconstruction as a historical 
style or period, we see deconstruction as a critical activity—an act of 
questioning. The visual resources of typography help demarcate Derrida’s
 ideological map of the biases governing Western art and philosophy. 
Having looked at deconstruction’s life in recent design culture, we will
 now locate design within the theory of deconstruction.</p>
<p>Design in Deconstruction</p>
<p>Derrida’s critique of the speech/writing opposition developed out of 
his reading of Ferdinand de Saussure’s Course in General Linguistics, a 
foundational text for modern linguistics, semiotics, and anthropology. 
Saussure asserted that the meaning of signs does not reside in the signs
 themselves: there is no natural bond between the signifier (the sign’s 
material aspect) and the signified (its referent). Instead, the meaning 
of a sign comes only from its relationship to other signs in a system. 
This principle is the basis of structuralism, an approach to language 
which focuses on the patterns or structures that generate meaning rather
 than on the “content” of a given code or custom.</p>
<p>Saussure revealed that because the sign has no inherent meaning, it 
is, taken by itself, empty, void, absent. The sign has no life apart 
from the system or “structure” of language. Saussure revealed that 
language is not a transparent window onto pre-existing concepts, but 
that language actively forms the realm of ideas. The base, material body
 of the signifier is not a secondary copy of the elevated, lofty realm 
of concepts: both are formless masses before the articulating work of 
language has sliced it into distinct pieces. Instead of thinking of 
language as a code for passively representing “thoughts,” Saussure 
showed that “thoughts” take shape out of the material body of language.</p>
<p>Derrida’s Of Grammatology points out that although Saussure was 
willing to reveal the emptiness at the heart of language, he became 
infuriated when he saw the same principle at work in writing, the system
 of signs created to represent speech. Saussure’s text views writing as a
 copy of speech, an artificial technology for reproducing language. 
While the alphabet claims to be a phonetic transcription of spoken 
sounds, codes such as written English are full of irrational spellings: 
for example, words that sound the same but are spelled differently 
(meet/meat), and letter combinations with unexpected pronunciations 
(th-, sh-, -ght). The tone of Saussure’s critique escalates from mild 
irritation at the beginning of his presentation to impassioned 
condemnation of the alphabet’s violation of an innocent, natural speech:
 “writing obscures language; it is not a guise for language but a 
disguise.” The “tyranny of writing” distorts its pristine referent 
through “orthographic monstrosities” and “phonic deformations” (30-2).</p>
<p>Saussure specifically concerned himself with phonetic writing, the 
paradigmatic medium of Western culture, which translates the diverse 
sounds of a language into a set of repeatable graphic marks. He 
explicitly excluded pictographic and ideographic scripts from his attack
 on writing; Chinese ideograms have fewer “annoying consequences” than 
the alphabet, because their users clearly understand their role as 
secondary signs for spoken words (26). The power (and seductiveness) of 
phonetic writing lies in its economy: a small number of characters can 
represent an ever-expanding quantity of words. Unlike pictographic or 
ideographic scripts, phonetic writing represents the signifier of 
language (its material sound) rather than the signified (its conceptual 
meaning or “idea”). Whereas an ideogram represents the concept of a 
word, phonetic characters merely represent its sounds. The alphabet thus
 embraces the arbitrariness of the sign by considering the signifier 
independently of its meaning.</p>
<p>As an intellectual technology, alphabetic writing can be compared to 
photography: it is an automatic record of the surface of language. The 
alphabet cleaved language into an inside and an outside: the destiny of 
phonetic writing is to occupy the outside, to be a mechanical copy of 
the signifier, leaving intact a sacred interior. The belief in the 
interiority, the fullness, of speech depends on the existence of an 
exterior, empty representation—the alphabet. Similarly, the notion of 
“nature,” as an ideal realm separate from human production, emerged as 
“civilization” was despoiling the broader ecological systems in which 
culture participates. To “deconstruct” the relationship between speech 
and writing is to reverse the status of the two terms, but not just to 
replace one with the other, but rather to show that speech was always 
already characterized by the same failure to transparently reflect 
reality. There is no innocent speech.</p>
<p>In Of Grammatology, Derrida asserted that an intellectual culture (or
 episteme) built on the opposition between reality and representation 
has, in fact, depended on representations to construct itself: 
“External/internal, image/reality, representation/presence, such is the 
old grid to which is given the task of outlining the domain of a 
science. And of what science? Of a science that can no longer answer to 
the classical concept of the episteme because the originality of its 
field—an originality that it inaugurates—is that the opening of the 
‘image’ within it appears as the condition of ‘reality,’ a relationship 
that can no longer be thought within the simple difference and the 
uncompromising exteriority of ‘image’ and ‘reality,’ of ‘outside’ and 
‘inside,’ of ‘appearance’ and ‘essence’ (33).” The fact that our culture
 developed a phonetic writing system—one which represents the material 
signifier in isolation from the sacred signified—is indicative of our 
primary alienation from the spoken language. Phonetic writing, because 
it makes use of the gap between signifier and signified, is not simply a
 secondary reflection of language, but is a symptom of language’s lack 
of presence, its lack of interior self-completeness.</p>
<p>Derrida’s final attack on the notion of writing as a secondary copy 
of speech is to make the claim that “phonetic writing does not exist” 
(39). Not only does writing inhabit speech, transforming its grammar and
 sound, and not only does phonetic writing exist as language’s “own 
other,” an “outside” manufactured to affirm its own complete 
“insidedness,” but this model of the “outside” continually fails to 
behave in the manner expected of it. Thus where Saussure had claimed 
that there are only two kinds of writing—phonetic and 
ideographic—Derrida found the frontiers between them to fluctuate.</p>
<p>Phonetic writing is full of non-phonetic elements and functions. Some
 signs used in conjunction with the alphabet are ideographic, including 
numbers and mathematical symbols. Other graphic marks cannot be called 
signs at all, because they do not represent distinct “signifieds” or 
concepts: for example, punctuation, flourishes, deletions, and patterns 
of difference such as roman/italic and uppercase/lowercase. What “idea” 
does the space between two words or a dingbat at the end of a line 
represent? Key among these marks, which Derrida has called “graphemes,” 
are various forms of spacing—negative gaps between the positive symbols 
of the alphabet. Spacing cannot be dismissed as a “simple accessory” of 
writing: “That a speech supposedly alive can lend itself to spacing in 
its own writing is what relates to its own death” (39). The alphabet has
 come to rely on silent graphic servants such as spacing and 
punctuation, which, like the frame of a picture, seem safely “outside” 
the proper content and internal structure of a work and yet are 
necessary conditions for making and reading.</p>
<p>Derrida’s book The Truth in Painting unfolds the logic of framing as a
 crucial component of works of art. In the Enlightenment aesthetics of 
Kant, which form the basis for modern art theory and criticism, the 
frame of a picture belongs to a class of elements called parerga, 
meaning “about the work,” or outside/around the work. Kant’s parerga 
include the columns on buildings, the draperies on statues, and the 
frames on pictures. A frame is an ornamental appendix to a work of art, 
whose “quasi-detachment” serves not only to hide but also to reveal the 
emptiness at the core of the seemingly self-complete object of aesthetic
 pleasure. In Derrida’s words, “The parergon is a form that has, as its 
traditonal determination, not that it stands out but that it disappears,
 buries itself, effaces itself, melts away at the moment it deploys its 
greatest energy. The frame is in no way a background….but neither is its
 thickness as margin a figure. Or at least it is a figure which comes 
away of its own accord” (61). Like the non-phonetic supplements to the 
alphabet, the borders around pictures or texts occupy an ambiguous place
 between figure and ground, positive element and negative gap.</p>
<p>Spacing and punctuation, borders and frames: these are the territory 
of graphic design and typography, those marginal arts which articulate 
the conditions that make texts and images readable. The substance of 
typography lies not in the alphabet per se—the generic forms of 
characters and their conventionalized uses—but rather in the visual 
framework and specific graphic forms which materialize the system of 
writing. Design and typography work at the edges of writing, determining
 the shape and style of letters, the spaces between them, and their 
positions on the page. Typography, from its position in the margins of 
communication, has moved writing away from speech.</p>
<p>Design as Deconstruction</p>
<p>The history of typography and writing could be written as the 
development of formal structures which have articulated and explored the
 border between the inside and the outside of the text. To compile a 
catalogue of the micro-mechanics of publishing—indexes and title pages, 
captions and colophons, folios and footnotes, leading and line lengths, 
margins and marginalia, spacing and punctuation—would contribute to the 
field which Derrida has called grammatology, or the study of writing as a
 distinctive mode of representation. This word, grammatology, serves to 
title the book whose more infamous legacy is deconstruction.</p>
<p>Such a history could position various typographic techniques in 
relation to the split between form and content, inside and outside. Some
 typographic conventions have served to rationalize the delivery of 
information by erecting transparent “crystal goblets” around a seemingly
 independent, neutral body of “content.” Some structures or approaches 
invade the sacred interior so deeply as to turn the text inside out, 
while others deliberately ignore or contradict the internal organization
 of a text in response to external pressures imposed by technology, 
aesthetics, corporate interests, social propriety, production 
conveniences, etc.</p>
<p>Robin Kinross’s Modern Typography (1992) charts the progressive 
rationalization of the forms and uses of letters across several 
centuries of European history. Kinross’s book characterizes printing as a
 prototypically “modern” process, that from its inception mobilized 
techniques of mass production and precipitated the mature arts and 
sciences. The seeds of modernization were present in Gutenberg’s first 
proofs; their fruits are born in the self-conscious methodologies, 
professionalized practices, and standardized visual forms of printers 
and typographers, which, beginning in the late seventeenth century, 
replaced an older notion of printing as a hermetic art of “black magic,”
 its methods jealously guarded by a caste of craftsmen.</p>
<p>If Kinross’s history of modern typography spans five centuries, so 
too might another history of deconstruction, running alongside and 
beneath the erection of transparent formal structures and coherent 
bodies of professional knowledge. Derrida’s own writing has drawn on 
forms of page layout from outside the accepted conventions of university
 publishing. His book Glas, designed with Richard Eckersley at the 
University of Nebraska Press, consists of parallel texts set in 
different typefaces and written in heterogeneous voices. Glas makes the 
scholarly annotations of medieval manuscripts and the accidental 
juxtapositions of modern newspapers part of a deliberate authorial 
strategy.</p>
<p>A study of typography and writing informed by deconstruction would 
reveal a range of structures that dramatize the intrusion of visual form
 into verbal content, the invasion of “ideas” by graphic marks, gaps, 
and differences. Figures 6 and 7, pages of late fifteenth-century book 
typography, represent two different attitudes towards framing the text. 
In the first, the margins are a transparent border for the solid block 
dominating the page. The lines of classical roman characters are 
minimally interrupted—paragraph breaks are indicated only by a wider gap
 within the line, preserving the text as a continuously flowing field of
 letters. The second example draws on the tradition of scribal 
marginalia and biblical commentary. Here, typography is an interpretive 
medium; the text is open rather than closed. The first example suggests 
that the frontiers between interior and exterior, figure and ground, 
reader and writer, are securely defined, while the second example 
dramatizes such divides by engulfing the center with the edge.</p>
<p>Another comparison comes from the history of the newspaper, which 
emerged as an elite literary medium in the seventeenth century. Early 
English newspapers based their structure on the classical book, whose 
consistently formatted text block was designed to be read from beginning
 to end. As the newspaper became a popular medium in nineteenth-century 
Europe and America, it expanded from a book-scaled signature to a 
broadsheet incorporating diverse elements, from reports of war and crime
 to announcements of ship departures and ads for goods and services. The
 modern illustrated newspaper of the twentieth century is a patchwork of
 competing elements, whose juxtaposition responds not to rational 
hierarchies of content but to the struggle between editorial, 
advertising, and production interests. While the structure of the 
classical news journal aspired to the status of a coherent, complete 
object, the appearance of the popular paper results from frantic 
compromises and arbitrary conditions; typographic design serves to 
distract and seduce as well as to clarify and explain.</p>
<p>Dictionaries of page design featuring schematic diagrams of typical 
layouts have been a common theme in twentieth-century design. Such 
visual enactments of theory include Jan Tschichold’s 1934 manifesto “The
 Placing of Type in a Given Space,” which charts a range of subtle 
variations in the placement of headings and body copy, and Don May’s 
1942 manual 101 Roughs, which catalogues various types of commercial 
page design. While Tschichold charted minor differences between clearly 
ordered elements, May accommodated the diverse media and competing 
messages found in advertising. Both theorists presented a series of 
formal containers for abstract, unspecified bodies of “content, “ but 
with a difference: Tschichold¹s structures are neutral frames for 
dominant textual figures, while May¹s patterns are active grounds which 
ignore conventional hierarchies in favor of such arbitrary rules as 
“Four point: The layout touches all four sides of the space once and 
only once” [Figure 8], or “Center axis: The heading copy, illustration, 
and logotype flush on alternate sides of axis.”</p>
<p>If one pursued the study of “grammatology” proposed by Derrida, the 
resulting catalogue of forms might include the graphic conditions 
outlined above. In each case, we have juxtaposed a coherent, seemingly 
self-complete literary artifact with a situation where external forces 
aggressively interfere with the sacred interior of content. A history of
 typography informed by deconstruction would show how graphic design has
 revealed, challenged, or transformed the accepted rules of 
communication. Such interventions can represent either deliberate 
confrontations or haphazard encounters with the social, technological, 
and aesthetic pressures that shape the making of texts.</p>
<p>In a 1994 interview in The New York Times Magazine, Derrida was asked
 about the purported “death” of deconstruction on North American 
campuses; he answered, “I think there is some element in deconstruction 
that belongs to the structure of history or events. It started before 
the academic phenomenon of deconstruction, and it will continue with 
other names.” In the spirit of this statement, we are interested in 
de-periodizing the relevance of deconstruction: instead of viewing it as
 an “ism” of the late-80s and early-90s, we see it as part of the 
ongoing development of design and typography as distinctive modes of 
representation. But deconstruction also belongs to culture: it is an 
operation that has taken a name and has spun a web of influence in 
particular social contexts. Deconstruction has lived in a variety of 
institutional worlds, from university literature departments to schools 
of art and design to the discourse of popular journalism, where it has 
functioned both as a critical activity and as a banner for a range of 
styles and attitudes. We will close our essay with two examples of 
graphic design that actively engage the language of contemporary media: 
the first confronts the politics of representation, while the second 
remakes design’s internal language.</p>
<p>Vincent Gagliostro’s cover for <span>NYQ</span> [Figure 10], a gay 
and lesbian news magazine, was designed in November, 1991, in response 
to Magic Johnson’s announcement that he is HIV+. Gagliostro imposed 
NYQ’s own logo and headline over a Newsweek cover featuring Magic 
Johnson proclaiming “Even me,” his upheld arms invoking saintly 
sacrifice and athletic vigor. “He is not our hero,” wrote <span>NYQ</span>
 over the existing cover. While Gagliostro’s layering and splicing of 
type and image are shared with more aestheticized, individualized 
gestures found elsewhere in contemporary design, this cover does not aim
 to trigger an infinite variety of “personal” interpretations but 
instead explicitly manipulates an ideologically loaded artifact. 
Gagliostro’s act of cultural rewriting is a powerful response to the 
ubiquity of normative sign systems, showing that the structures of mass 
media can be reshuffled and reinhabited. The <span>NYQ</span> cover 
reveals and exploits the function of framing as a transformative process
 that refuses to remain outside the editorial content it encloses.</p>
<p>The manipulation of existing media imagery is one activity in 
contemporary design that can be described as deconstruction; another is 
the exploration of the visual grammar of communication, from print to 
the electronic interface. Designers working in hypermedia are developing
 new ways to generate, distribute, and use information—they are 
reinventing the language of graphic design today, just as typographers 
reacted to the changing technologies and social functions of printed 
media in the past. A leading pioneer of this research was Muriel Cooper,
 who founded the Visible Language Workshop at <span>MIT</span> in 197X. 
In the wake of her death in the spring of 1994, her students are 
continuing to build a concrete grammar of three-dimensional, dynamic 
typography. Cooper called the basic elements of this language “geometric
 primitives,” defined by relationships of size, brightness, color, 
transparency, and location in 3-D space, variables which can shift in 
response to the user¹s position in a document. Cooper and her students 
have worked to restructure the internal language of typography in four 
dimensions.</p>
<p>Spacing, framing, punctuation, type style, layout, and other 
nonphonetic marks of difference constitute the material interface of 
writing. Traditional literary and linguistic research overlook such 
graphic structures, focusing instead on the Word as the center of 
communication. According to Derrida, the functions of repetition, 
quotation, and fragmentation that characterize writing are conditions 
endemic to all human expression—even the seemingly spontaneous, 
self-present utterances of speech or the smooth, naturalistic surfaces 
of painting and photography. Design can critically engage the mechanics 
of representation, exposing and revising its ideological biases; design 
also can remake the grammar of communication by discovering structures 
and patterns within the material media of visual and verbal writing.</p>
