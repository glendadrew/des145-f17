            Researching history and situating contemporary visual communications in an historic or theoretical context is a critical aspect of a great designer
        </blockquote>

        <h2>Individual research</h2>

        <blockquote>Each student will research and prepare a 1-2 minute presentation with 1 slide of an example of contemporary visual communication design that is related to the assigned chapter images of Cramsie (group numbers correlate to Cramsie chapters, see the schedule page for assigned images for each chapter). If there are fewer assigned images than group members, use an image/topic from the chapter that was included in lecture. Consider topics that are interesting and relevant to the young designers in the class. Contemporary design-related tools and strategies make great content!</blockquote>

        <h3 style="margin-bottom:12px;">Think and answer: </h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Who made the design in the image? </li>
            <li>Approximately when was it made? </li>
            <li>What is the form and content of the image? </li>
            <li>How does it relate to the Cramsie readings?</li>
            <li>What is your critical response to the content?</li>
            <li>&nbsp;</li>
            <li>No repeat topics…let’s keep it fresh ☺...check the list of previous topics and add your name and topic here: <a href="https://canvas.ucdavis.edu/courses/177492/pages/group-topics">https://canvas.ucdavis.edu/courses/177492/pages/group-topics</a></li>
        </ul>


        <h2>Group Presentation</h2>
        <blockquote> Students will give their individual presentations as part of their whole group. Groups must meet outside of class to coordinate presentations with an introduction, logical flow and conclusion. Group presentations must be organized into a single pdf file (Google Slides, Keynote, Powerpoint, Prezi, etc, can all export to pdf) and uploaded to the <a href="https://canvas.ucdavis.edu/courses/177492/assignments/111504">Canvas Assignment</a> by 10pm on the evening before the presentation. Title the file in the following format: group_<em>groupnumber</em>.pdf, such as <em>group1-2.pdf</em>. <strong>Do not submit as a link to a google (or any other) file</strong></blockquote>
        <blockquote>Individual presentations must have the level of depth that is equivalent to research conducted for an academic paper. Remember to communicate to your audience! Dull presentations receive lower grades. The quality of the presentation must meet basic design guidelines for effective visual presentations:</blockquote>

        <h2>Summary Paper</h2>
        <blockquote>
            A one-page, double-spaced, printed summary of the research with a complete bibliography is due at the start of the presentation. If you need to read notes from your paper, bring two copies (one for the instructor and one for yourself). The quality of writing must meet UC academic standards. Although the bibliography may include website references, <em>you must refer to the Cramsie book</em>. If you do not have copyright for the image, cite the copyright in the bibliography </blockquote>
