            Exhibitions inspire and sharpen critical thinking and evaluation.
        </p>

        <p>Visit and write a review of a design (or closely related) exhibition. Because no formal field trip will be organized, you are responsible for your own transportation to view the exhibition by the end of the quarter. You must review one exhibition from the following list. <strong>You may review a different exhibition only with prior approval from the instructor.</strong></p>

        <p>Some questions to consider include: Who made the work? What is included in the exhibition? What is not included in the exhibition? Why is this work/exhibition relevant? What is the intention and impact of the work exhibited? Under what conditions (physical, social, economic, geographic, psychological, technical, technological) was the work made? Who is the audience? To what major historical or theoretical context is this exhibition related?</p>

        <p>The quality of writing must meet UC academic standards. Exhibition reviews are formal; see the Sacramento News &amp; Review or New York Times. Do not be too casual; avoid using “nice.” Do not use a first-person point-of-view. Do not address your audience as “you.” The goal is to inform the reader and thereby deepen the reader’s experience. The reader learns the most when the work is positioned within a historical or theoretical context. <strong><em>You must include a reference to Cramsie and at least one additional information source (with bibliography).</em></strong></p>

        <p>Be aware that some exhibitions require advanced ticket purchase, and some require a special fee. Many museums offer student rates with current ID. Check on-line for information as you plan your visit. </p>

      <p style="margin-bottom:0px;"><u>Submit by December 4 (or anytime sooner)</u></p><br>
        <ul style="margin-left:-20px;">
            <li>1-2	page typed review printout with bibliography (double-spaced; last name, first name in upper right)</li>
            <li>Admission ticket attached (or other proof of attendance…selfie!) </li>
        </ul>


        <p>Note: Work can be submitted at the final for 85% credit.</p>
